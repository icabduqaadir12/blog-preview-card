## üöß My Process

I started by analyzing the design provided by Frontend Mentor. I structured the layout using semantic HTML5 and styled it with mobile-first CSS. I focused on using Flexbox for alignment and spacing, and ensured the component was visually balanced with proper padding, typography, and border radius. I paid attention to details like button spacing and color contrast for accessibility and polished look.

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS Flexbox**
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Mobile-first** responsive design
- Clean and accessible layout

### What I Learned

- Writing clean and maintainable CSS using utility classes and spacing
- Structuring a component-based layout with clear visual hierarchy
- Applying responsive design techniques for small screens
- Improving code readability and consistency with variables and naming conventions

### Continued Development

- Learn and apply accessibility best practices
- Use SCSS or utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS
- Rebuild this component using JavaScript or React
